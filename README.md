# phishing-example
A very simple phishing website example who sends the data to a discord webhook.

This is done by doing a POST request to Discord using the fetch() API in order to execute the webhook : https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook#execute-webhook

You can just add CSS to make it look like the website you want.
